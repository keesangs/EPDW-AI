EPDW AI Analytics

Please find the sample benchmark datasets.
There are 10 different benchmark datasets from each BIOS version

- SPECJBB

- SPECCPU 2017
  SPEC CPU benchmarks provide two primary metrics: 'base' and 'peak' values.
    Base:
         Uses a more conservative set of compiler optimizations2.
         Applies the same compiler flags for all benchmarks in the suite4.
         Represents how a typical user might compile a program with standard flags4.
    Peak:
         Employs more aggressive compiler optimizations2.
         Allows for benchmark-specific optimizations and a wider range of compiler flags4.
         Represents the best possible performance achievable with more extensive tuning

- TPC-C Maria DB

Example query for Gen AI for result analysis:
 
- Which is the best run based on following data (data can shared via file upload or text format)
- What is performance for a particular configuration (ex. for a set of nps, smt, turbo)
- Follow up question can be is BIOS version same?
- Follow up can be for value of particular configuration on server (including BIOS)
- Which configuration gives best performance metric on X EPYC Platform
